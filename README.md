Description:
In this game, the player will explore a strange planet plagued with ominous features, creatures and environments.
I'm aiming to give the planet an eerie feeling and a sense of unfamiliarity. Some of the creatures will the dangerous to the player.
Some of the environments will be treacherous, so the player will have to be cautious of that too.
The player will have a gun to defend himself (probably some sort of futuristic laser gun to show off some cool sort of projectile)
Through some maths functions and other calculations, the creatures will behave, move and look oddly, like an unknown alien creature.

I want to add support for multiplayer too. Currently, I'd like to have the players compete against each other in some way.
The players will have to collect crystals that will randomly spawn around the map.
On death, a player will drop a crystal which can then be collected by the other player. First to X amount of crystals wins.
The objective of this game may change in the future but for now, this is what I hope to do.

I'm not purely basing the planet on anything. Honestly, I'm making it as I go along and seeing what ways I can implement complexity.
However, I may take some inspiration from the game World of Warcraft, as this features a land named "Outland" which looks like an alien planet.

As for code, I am looking up things as I need them. I'm sure I will use some of the material covered in the labs such as the "tentacle" like movement.
I found https://www.youtube.com/user/Brackeys/videos in particular to be quite helpful for a few things.
